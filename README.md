# RETriforce

This repo contains sample usage for [Capstone](http://www.capstone-engine.org), [Keystone](http://www.keystone-engine.org) and [Unicorn](http://www.unicorn-engine.org).

This material was used in a couple of Cyberspace Camp YouTube videos that I blew away and didn't have backups for. I may re-create this video in the future, if I do, I'll update this readme with a link to the video.

Until then, there is a `Dockerfile` that will allow you to easily install and use this "RETriforce", a Slide deck with some notes about each of these tools (in PDF and PowerPoint formats), and a sample problem to work through.

If you're new to Capstone, Keystone or Unicorn, please go through the slide deck and play with the sample problem.  If you have any questions or issues feel free to shoot me questions at cetfor/gmail.
